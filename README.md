# Hoverpod X  FPGA based Autonomous Hovering Camera Platform

** Hoverpod X ** is an open-source, FPGA-powered smart camera platform that replaces traditional tripods. Designed to track user movement and stabilize mobile phones like the iPhone during filming, Hoverpod X is ideal for vloggers, athletes and content creators seeking hands-free, smooth video capture. 

## Project Overview 
This project explores the use of FPGAs for real-time motor control, PWM signal generation and stabilization logic to build a self-balancing, hovering platform. It leverages BLDC motors fir veritical lift and servo motors for pan/tilt control of an iphone mount.

## Key Features 
- FPGA based PWM signal genration (verilog)
- BLDC motor control via ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
- Servo pan/tilt system for camera orientation
- Sensor integration for stabilization (IMU planned)
- Modular Verilog architecture with simulation support
- Open source and well documented for education use

## System Architecture 
1. ** Payload Layer (Camera Mount & Stabilization)**
  - iPhone Mount on a servo driven gimbal
  - Controlled via FPGA generated PWM signals
  - Allows pan/tilt to keep subject centered
2. ** Control Layer (FPGA Core Logic) **
  This is the brain of the system. Implemented on the Basys 3 FPGA.
    Verilog Modules:
  - pwm_generator.v: Produces PWM signals for both BLDC motors via ESCs and servos
  - esc_controller.v: Interfaces with ESCs to control BLDC speed
  - servo_controller.v: Controls the pan/tilt gimbal via SG90/MG996R servos
  - imu_interface.v: Reads orientation from MPU6050 
  - pid_controller.v: Implements stabilization logic for flight balance
  - tracker_interface.v: (Future development): Takes in user position data from sensor tags for       tracking
3. ** Actuation Layer (Motors & Servo)**
  - 4x BLDC motors provide lift, controlled via ESCs
  - Servo motors adjust the iphone gimbal's angle
  - All motors receive PWM signals from the FPGA
4. ** Power & Regulation Layer**
  - 4S LiPo Battery (14.8 V)
    - Directly powers ESCs + BLDC motors
    - Passed through a buck converter (LM2596) to power:
      - FPGA (5V regulated) via barrel jack
      - Servos (5V) with adequate current
    - Shared Ground across all components to ensure reliable signal integrity
  - Allows pan/tilt to keep subject centered
